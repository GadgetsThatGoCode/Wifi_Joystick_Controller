Wifi Joystick Controller For WeMos Project

The Joystick Controls the movement of a bot that uses two motors by sending back input for the speed and direction of the motors.
When you hover the mouse over the joystick image on a desktop computer the joystick ball will follow the mouse position. 
The inputs for both motors get determined by the location of joystick ball. 
The speed is determined by how far away the joystick is from center. 
The direction is gauged from the x,y position of the joystick ball.
The Joystick Controller Takes the input of the D1 Mini's given IP in the following format: ws://[IP]:[Port Number]

Example: ws://192.168.2.5:81
